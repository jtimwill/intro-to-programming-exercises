From the article: \"For $20 a month &mdash; yes, twenty dollars &mdash; you get access to a lineup of cable networks that includes TNT, TBS, CNN, Food Network, HGTV, Cartoon Network, Adult Swim, the Disney Channel, ESPN, and ESPN2. ESPN is obviously a huge get for Dish and could earn Sling TV plenty of customers all on its own. ESPN just ended another year as TV's leading cable network, and now you won't need a traditional cable package to watch it. For sports fanatics, that could prove enticing. But Dish has hinted that there may be limits on watching ESPN on mobile thanks to red tape from existing deals between the network and Verizon.\"<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\"> <a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Dish+Introduces+%2420-a-Month+Streaming-TV+Service%3A+http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1ytwGVV\"><img src=\"http://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a> <a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fentertainment.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F15%2F01%2F05%2F2115219%2Fdish-introduces-20-a-month-streaming-tv-service%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"http://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a> <a class=\"nobg\" href=\"http://plus.google.com/share?url=http://entertainment.slashdot.org/story/15/01/05/2115219/dish-introduces-20-a-month-streaming-tv-service?utm_source=slashdot&amp;utm_medium=googleplus\" onclick=\"javascript:window.open(this.href,'', 'menubar=no,toolbar=no,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes,height=600,width=600');return false;\"><img src=\"http://www.gstatic.com/images/icons/gplus-16.png\" alt=\"Share on Google+\"/></a> </div></p><p><a href=\"http://entertainment.slashdot.org/story/15/01/05/2115219/dish-introduces-20-a-month-streaming-tv-service?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"http://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=6636221&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe><img width='1' height='1' src='http://slashdot.feedsportal.com/c/35028/f/647410/s/420776b9/sc/21/mf.gif' border='0'/><br clear='all'/><br/><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443496498/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/420776b9/sc/21/rc/1/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443496498/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/420776b9/sc/21/rc/1/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443496498/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/420776b9/sc/21/rc/2/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443496498/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/420776b9/sc/21/rc/2/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443496498/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/420776b9/sc/21/rc/3/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443496498/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/420776b9/sc/21/rc/3/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443496498/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/420776b9/sc/21/a2.htm\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443496498/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/420776b9/sc/21/a2.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/216443496498/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/420776b9/sc/21/a2t.img\" border=\"0\"/><img src=\"//feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~4/9bdaGnRLKn0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>"}, {:title=>"Intel Unveils 5th Gen Core Series Broadwell-U CPUs and Cherry Trail Atom", :link=>"http://rss.slashdot.org/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~3/P7yscTRTl4c/story01.htm", :summary=>"MojoKid writes Intel has officially taken the wraps off its 5th generation Core Series notebook processor, code named Broadwell-U. This new SoC is a \"tick\" in Intel's tick-tock plan, which means it's mostly a die shrink of the existing Haswell architecture, at least on the CPU side. On the GPU side, there's a bevy of improvements and advances, and the video decoder block has been beefed up with dual bit stream decoders in its high-end (GT3) hardware. Other feature improvements and capabilities are expected, though Intel has been quiet on exactly what they have tweaked and changed to date. Intel is claiming that the architecture will boost battery life by 1.5 hours, speed video conversions, and offer a whopping 22% improvement to 3D performance &mdash; a gain on par with what we saw when moving from Ivy Bridge to Haswell. Intel also took the wraps off their next gen Atom CPU, code named Cherry Trail. This is essentially a 14nm Bay Trail die shrink that's been on the roadmap for a while. As with Haswell-Broadwell, the Bay Trail-Cherry Trail shift is aimed at improving CPU power consumption and overall SoC power characteristics, though again, we'll see an updated GPU baked in as well.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\"> <a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Intel+Unveils+5th+Gen+Core+Series+Broadwell-U+CPUs+and+Cherry+Trail+Atom%3A+http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1Apsiph\"><img src=\"http://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a> <a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fhardware.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F15%2F01%2F05%2F1844225%2Fintel-unveils-5th-gen-core-series-broadwell-u-cpus-and-cherry-trail-atom%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"http://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a> <a class=\"nobg\" href=\"http://plus.google.com/share?url=http://hardware.slashdot.org/story/15/01/05/1844225/intel-unveils-5th-gen-core-series-broadwell-u-cpus-and-cherry-trail-atom?utm_source=slashdot&amp;utm_medium=googleplus\" onclick=\"javascript:window.open(this.href,'', 'menubar=no,toolbar=no,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes,height=600,width=600');return false;\"><img src=\"http://www.gstatic.com/images/icons/gplus-16.png\" alt=\"Share on Google+\"/></a> </div></p><p><a href=\"http://hardware.slashdot.org/story/15/01/05/1844225/intel-unveils-5th-gen-core-series-broadwell-u-cpus-and-cherry-trail-atom?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"http://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=6635815&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe><img width='1' height='1' src='http://slashdot.feedsportal.com/c/35028/f/647410/s/42076f3b/sc/15/mf.gif' border='0'/><br clear='all'/><br/><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443495514/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42076f3b/sc/15/rc/1/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443495514/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42076f3b/sc/15/rc/1/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443495514/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42076f3b/sc/15/rc/2/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443495514/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42076f3b/sc/15/rc/2/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443495514/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42076f3b/sc/15/rc/3/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443495514/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42076f3b/sc/15/rc/3/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443495514/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42076f3b/sc/15/a2.htm\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443495514/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42076f3b/sc/15/a2.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/216443495514/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42076f3b/sc/15/a2t.img\" border=\"0\"/><img src=\"//feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~4/P7yscTRTl4c\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>"}, {:title=>"Who's Responsible When Your Semi-Autonomous Shopping Bot Purchases Drugs Online?", :link=>"http://rss.slashdot.org/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~3/TrI35MEWo5E/story01.htm", :summary=>"Nerval's Lobster writes Who's responsible when a bot breaks the law? A collective of Swiss artists faced that very question when they coded the Random Darknet Shopper, an online shopping bot, to purchase random items from a marketplace located on the Deep Web, an area of the World Wide Web not indexed by search engines. While many of the 16,000 items for sale on this marketplace are legal, quite a few are not; and when the bot used its $100-per-week-in-Bitcoin to purchase a handful of illegal pills and a fake Hungarian passport, the artists found themselves in one of those conundrums unique to the 21st century: Is one liable when a bunch of semi-autonomous code goes off and does something bad? In a short piece in The Guardian, the artists seemed prepared to face the legal consequences of their software's actions, but nothing had happened yet&mdash;even though the gallery displaying the items is reportedly next door to a police station. In addition to the drugs and passport, the bot ordered a box set of The Lord of the Rings, a Louis Vuitton handbag, a couple of cartons of Chesterfield Blue cigarettes, sneakers, knockoff jeans, and much more.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\"> <a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Who's+Responsible+When+Your+Semi-Autonomous+Shopping+Bot+Purchases+Drugs+Online%3F%3A+http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1vUybpn\"><img src=\"http://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a> <a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftech.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F15%2F01%2F05%2F1854222%2Fwhos-responsible-when-your-semi-autonomous-shopping-bot-purchases-drugs-online%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"http://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a> <a class=\"nobg\" href=\"http://plus.google.com/share?url=http://tech.slashdot.org/story/15/01/05/1854222/whos-responsible-when-your-semi-autonomous-shopping-bot-purchases-drugs-online?utm_source=slashdot&amp;utm_medium=googleplus\" onclick=\"javascript:window.open(this.href,'', 'menubar=no,toolbar=no,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes,height=600,width=600');return false;\"><img src=\"http://www.gstatic.com/images/icons/gplus-16.png\" alt=\"Share on Google+\"/></a> </div></p><p><a href=\"http://tech.slashdot.org/story/15/01/05/1854222/whos-responsible-when-your-semi-autonomous-shopping-bot-purchases-drugs-online?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"http://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=6635865&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe><img width='1' height='1' src='http://slashdot.feedsportal.com/c/35028/f/647410/s/420728a8/sc/36/mf.gif' border='0'/><br clear='all'/><br/><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443556503/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/420728a8/sc/36/rc/1/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443556503/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/420728a8/sc/36/rc/1/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443556503/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/420728a8/sc/36/rc/2/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443556503/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/420728a8/sc/36/rc/2/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443556503/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/420728a8/sc/36/rc/3/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443556503/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/420728a8/sc/36/rc/3/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443556503/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/420728a8/sc/36/a2.htm\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443556503/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/420728a8/sc/36/a2.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/216443556503/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/420728a8/sc/36/a2t.img\" border=\"0\"/><img src=\"//feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~4/TrI35MEWo5E\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>"}, {:title=>"FCC Revamps Customer Complaint System", :link=>"http://rss.slashdot.org/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~3/MyrFnYqnJT4/story01.htm", :summary=>"blottsie writes The FCC has heard your complaints, and it's finally going to make it easier to file more complaints.

A survey of writers around the world by the PEN American Center has found that a significant majority said they were deeply concerned with government surveillance, with many reporting that they have avoided, or have considered avoiding, controversial topics in their work or in personal communications as a result. The findings show that writers consider freedom of expression to be under significant threat around the world in democratic and nondemocratic countries. Some 75 percent of respondents in countries classified as \"free,\" 84 percent in \"partly free\" countries, and 80 percent in countries that were \"not free\" said that they were \"very\" or \"somewhat\" worried about government surveillance in their countries. The survey, which will be released Monday, was conducted anonymously online in fall 2014 and yielded 772 responses from fiction and nonfiction writers and related professionals, including translators and editors, in 50 countries.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\"> <a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Writers+Say+They+Feel+Censored+By+Surveillance%3A+http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1Ax1Tad\"><img src=\"http://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a> <a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fyro.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F15%2F01%2F05%2F1445202%2Fwriters-say-they-feel-censored-by-surveillance%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"http://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a> <a class=\"nobg\" href=\"http://plus.google.com/share?url=http://yro.slashdot.org/story/15/01/05/1445202/writers-say-they-feel-censored-by-surveillance?utm_source=slashdot&amp;utm_medium=googleplus\" onclick=\"javascript:window.open(this.href,'', 'menubar=no,toolbar=no,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes,height=600,width=600');return false;\"><img src=\"http://www.gstatic.com/images/icons/gplus-16.png\" alt=\"Share on Google+\"/></a> </div></p><p><a href=\"http://yro.slashdot.org/story/15/01/05/1445202/writers-say-they-feel-censored-by-surveillance?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"http://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=6634599&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe><img width='1' height='1' src='http://slashdot.feedsportal.com/c/35028/f/647410/s/42069bcd/sc/1/mf.gif' border='0'/><br clear='all'/><br/><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443505850/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42069bcd/sc/1/rc/1/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443505850/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42069bcd/sc/1/rc/1/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443505850/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42069bcd/sc/1/rc/2/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443505850/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42069bcd/sc/1/rc/2/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443505850/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42069bcd/sc/1/rc/3/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443505850/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42069bcd/sc/1/rc/3/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443505850/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42069bcd/sc/1/a2.htm\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443505850/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42069bcd/sc/1/a2.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/216443505850/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42069bcd/sc/1/a2t.img\" border=\"0\"/><img src=\"//feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~4/y6gYQW8E9G4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>"}, {:title=>"In Daring Plan, Tomorrow SpaceX To Land a Rocket On Floating Platform", :link=>"http://rss.slashdot.org/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~3/ageOWXQZR24/story01.htm", :summary=>"HughPickens.com writes \"The cost of getting to orbit is exorbitant, because the rocket, with its multimillion-dollar engines, ends up as trash in the ocean after one launching, something Elon Musk likens to throwing away a 747 jet after a single transcontinental flight. That's why tomorrow morning at 620 am his company hopes to upend the economics of space travel in a daring plan by attempting to land the first stage of a Falcon 9 rocket intact on a floating platform, 300 feet long and 170 feet wide in the Atlantic Ocean. SpaceX has attempted similar maneuvers on three earlier Falcon 9 flights, and on the second and third attempts, the rocket slowed to a hover before splashing into the water. \"We've been able to soft-land the rocket booster in the ocean twice so far,\" says Musk. \"Unfortunately, it sort of sat there for several seconds, then tipped over and exploded. It's quite difficult to reuse at that point.\" After the booster falls away and the second stage continues pushing the payload to orbit, its engines will reignite to turn it around and guide it to a spot about 200 miles east of Jacksonville, Florida. Musk puts the chances of success at 50 percent or less but over the dozen or so flights scheduled for this year, \"I think it's quite likely, 80 to 90 percent likely, that one of those flights will be able to land and refly.\" SpaceX will offer its own launch webcast on the company's website beginning at 6 a.m. If SpaceX's gamble succeeds, the company plans to reuse the rocket stage on a later flight. \"Reusability is the critical breakthrough needed in rocketry to take things to the next level.\" SpaceX announced the plan in December.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\"> <a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=In+Daring+Plan%2C+Tomorrow+SpaceX+To+Land+a+Rocket+On+Floating+Platform%3A+http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F14pYT3o\"><img src=\"http://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a> <a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fscience.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F15%2F01%2F05%2F172259%2Fin-daring-plan-tomorrow-spacex-to-land-a-rocket-on-floating-platform%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"http://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a> <a class=\"nobg\" href=\"http://plus.google.com/share?url=http://science.slashdot.org/story/15/01/05/172259/in-daring-plan-tomorrow-spacex-to-land-a-rocket-on-floating-platform?utm_source=slashdot&amp;utm_medium=googleplus\" onclick=\"javascript:window.open(this.href,'', 'menubar=no,toolbar=no,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes,height=600,width=600');return false;\"><img src=\"http://www.gstatic.com/images/icons/gplus-16.png\" alt=\"Share on Google+\"/></a> </div></p><p><a href=\"http://science.slashdot.org/story/15/01/05/172259/in-daring-plan-tomorrow-spacex-to-land-a-rocket-on-floating-platform?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"http://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=6635389&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe><img width='1' height='1' src='http://slashdot.feedsportal.com/c/35028/f/647410/s/42065f07/sc/36/mf.gif' border='0'/><br clear='all'/><br/><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443490911/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42065f07/sc/36/rc/1/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443490911/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42065f07/sc/36/rc/1/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443490911/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42065f07/sc/36/rc/2/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443490911/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42065f07/sc/36/rc/2/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443490911/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42065f07/sc/36/rc/3/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443490911/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42065f07/sc/36/rc/3/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443490911/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42065f07/sc/36/a2.htm\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443490911/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42065f07/sc/36/a2.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/216443490911/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42065f07/sc/36/a2t.img\" border=\"0\"/><img src=\"//feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~4/ageOWXQZR24\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>"}, {:title=>"Nest Will Now Work With Your Door Locks, Light Bulbs and More", :link=>"http://rss.slashdot.org/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~3/HO-YCFBB_Mo/story01.htm", :summary=>"An anonymous reader writes with news about 15 new brand partnerships Nest announced today. \"When Google purchased Nest Labs &ndash; the maker of Internet-connected thermostats and smoke detectors &ndash; the search engine giant saw the potential to create a software platform for controlling the myriad everyday devices and gadgets in consumers' homes, a central hub for the so-called \"Internet of things.\" This vision took a major step towards becoming reality Monday morning, when Nest announced at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas that 15 new partners were joining its \"Works with Nest\" developer program.

The Ambulance Drone and Defikopter, for example, are used for transporting defibrillators to those in need. Now, Project Ryptide plans to use drones to deliver life-rings to swimmers in distress. From the article: \"The project, which is at pre-production prototype stage, was conceived by Bill Piedra, a part-time teacher at the King Low Heywood Thomas (KLHT) school in Stamford, Connecticut. Piedra began working on the design in January 2014 and then began developing it further with students at KLHT in September 2014. 'Ryptide was designed so that anyone can be a lifeguard,' Piedra tells Gizmag. 'We had the casual user in mind when we designed the basic model; someone that might take their drone to the beach, boating, a lake, or even ice skating. It could be useful in the case of someone falling through the ice while skating, for example.'\"<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\"> <a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Project+Ryptide+Drone+Flies+Life-Rings+To+Distressed+Swimmers%3A+http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F14pByPz\"><img src=\"http://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a> <a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftech.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F15%2F01%2F05%2F1454252%2Fproject-ryptide-drone-flies-life-rings-to-distressed-swimmers%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"http://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a> <a class=\"nobg\" href=\"http://plus.google.com/share?url=http://tech.slashdot.org/story/15/01/05/1454252/project-ryptide-drone-flies-life-rings-to-distressed-swimmers?utm_source=slashdot&amp;utm_medium=googleplus\" onclick=\"javascript:window.open(this.href,'', 'menubar=no,toolbar=no,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes,height=600,width=600');return false;\"><img src=\"http://www.gstatic.com/images/icons/gplus-16.png\" alt=\"Share on Google+\"/></a> </div></p><p><a href=\"http://tech.slashdot.org/story/15/01/05/1454252/project-ryptide-drone-flies-life-rings-to-distressed-swimmers?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"http://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=6634683&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe><img width='1' height='1' src='http://slashdot.feedsportal.com/c/35028/f/647410/s/42057862/sc/4/mf.gif' border='0'/><br clear='all'/><br/><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443500908/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42057862/sc/4/rc/1/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443500908/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42057862/sc/4/rc/1/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443500908/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42057862/sc/4/rc/2/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443500908/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42057862/sc/4/rc/2/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443500908/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42057862/sc/4/rc/3/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443500908/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42057862/sc/4/rc/3/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443500908/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42057862/sc/4/a2.htm\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443500908/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42057862/sc/4/a2.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/216443500908/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42057862/sc/4/a2t.img\" border=\"0\"/><img src=\"//feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~4/-V2-6XUyYBE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>"}, {:title=>"Bitstamp Bitcoin Exchange Suspended Due To \"Compromised Wallet\"", :link=>"http://rss.slashdot.org/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~3/qo7NOL4oJJQ/story01.htm", :summary=>"twitnutttt writes Customers of Bistamp, the successor (until recently) to MtGox as the highest-volume dollar-denominated Bitcoin exchange, and still the preferred source of trading data for many technical analysts, sent an email at about 4:00 UTC today warning that, \"Today our transaction processing server detected problems with our hot wallet and stopped processing withdrawals.\" They also instructed users to stop sending any deposits immediately or they may be lost.

Today, NVIDIA unveiled its upcoming Tegra X1 system on a chip (SoC) and a few automotive computer systems leveraging the chip. Tegra X1 is a significant departure from the previous-gen Tegra K1 in that it features a 256 core Maxwell-derived GPU and eight CPU cores; four ARM A57 cores and four A53s in a big.LITTLE configuration. NVIDIA claims the Tegra X1 offers up to 2x the performance of the Tegra K1 in a similar power envelope, thanks to improved efficiency in the CPU and GPU cores and because the chips will be built using TSMC's 20nm manufacturing process. In addition to the Tegra X1 itself, NVIDIA also announced some new automotive computing platforms, the NVIDIA Drive CX Digital Cockpit Computer and Drive PX Auto-Pilot Platform, along with the Drive Studio software suite for developing in-car infotainment systems and autonomous driving systems.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\"> <a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=NVIDIA+Announces+Tegra+X1+Chip+and+Drive+CX+and+PX+Automotive+Platforms%3A+http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1yrzX8f\"><img src=\"http://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a> <a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fhardware.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F15%2F01%2F05%2F1231242%2Fnvidia-announces-tegra-x1-chip-and-drive-cx-and-px-automotive-platforms%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"http://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a> <a class=\"nobg\" href=\"http://plus.google.com/share?url=http://hardware.slashdot.org/story/15/01/05/1231242/nvidia-announces-tegra-x1-chip-and-drive-cx-and-px-automotive-platforms?utm_source=slashdot&amp;utm_medium=googleplus\" onclick=\"javascript:window.open(this.href,'', 'menubar=no,toolbar=no,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes,height=600,width=600');return false;\"><img src=\"http://www.gstatic.com/images/icons/gplus-16.png\" alt=\"Share on Google+\"/></a> </div></p><p><a href=\"http://hardware.slashdot.org/story/15/01/05/1231242/nvidia-announces-tegra-x1-chip-and-drive-cx-and-px-automotive-platforms?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"http://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=6633127&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe><img width='1' height='1' src='http://slashdot.feedsportal.com/c/35028/f/647410/s/42043910/sc/23/mf.gif' border='0'/><br clear='all'/><br/><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443494877/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42043910/sc/23/rc/1/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443494877/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42043910/sc/23/rc/1/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443494877/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42043910/sc/23/rc/2/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443494877/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42043910/sc/23/rc/2/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443494877/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42043910/sc/23/rc/3/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443494877/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42043910/sc/23/rc/3/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443494877/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42043910/sc/23/a2.htm\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443494877/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42043910/sc/23/a2.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/216443494877/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42043910/sc/23/a2t.img\" border=\"0\"/><img src=\"//feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~4/e7PTuh3qiVQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>"}, {:title=>"Ancient Planes and Other Claims Spark Controversy at Indian Science Congress", :link=>"http://rss.slashdot.org/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~3/rK1uqj4A88I/story01.htm", :summary=>"An anonymous reader writes A paper presented at the 102nd Indian Science Congress on Sunday claims that Indians had mastered aviation thousands of years before the Wright brothers.

OP was forced to open a helpline for customers unable to confirm payments or transfer money because of jammed systems. On Saturday the firm said it would compensate people for any losses or late payment fees incurred as a result of attack. On Sunday morning the bank tweeted that its services were operating normally and even customers based outside Finland were able to access their accounts &mdash; and that it was still monitoring traffic carefully to try and ward off any renewed strikes. However, on Sunday afternoon further denial of service attacks took place delaying payments and preventing access to banking services for OP customers.

Intel is claiming that the architecture will boost battery life by 1.5 hours, speed video conversions, and offer a whopping 22% improvement to 3D performance &mdash; a gain on par with what we saw when moving from Ivy Bridge to Haswell. Intel also took the wraps off their next gen Atom CPU, code named Cherry Trail. This is essentially a 14nm Bay Trail die shrink that's been on the roadmap for a while. As with Haswell-Broadwell, the Bay Trail-Cherry Trail shift is aimed at improving CPU power consumption and overall SoC power characteristics, though again, we'll see an updated GPU baked in as well.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\"> <a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Intel+Unveils+5th+Gen+Core+Series+Broadwell-U+CPUs+and+Cherry+Trail+Atom%3A+http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1Apsiph\"><img src=\"http://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a> <a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fhardware.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F15%2F01%2F05%2F1844225%2Fintel-unveils-5th-gen-core-series-broadwell-u-cpus-and-cherry-trail-atom%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"http://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a> <a class=\"nobg\" href=\"http://plus.google.com/share?url=http://hardware.slashdot.org/story/15/01/05/1844225/intel-unveils-5th-gen-core-series-broadwell-u-cpus-and-cherry-trail-atom?utm_source=slashdot&amp;utm_medium=googleplus\" onclick=\"javascript:window.open(this.href,'', 'menubar=no,toolbar=no,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes,height=600,width=600');return false;\"><img src=\"http://www.gstatic.com/images/icons/gplus-16.png\" alt=\"Share on Google+\"/></a> </div></p><p><a href=\"http://hardware.slashdot.org/story/15/01/05/1844225/intel-unveils-5th-gen-core-series-broadwell-u-cpus-and-cherry-trail-atom?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"http://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=6635815&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe><img width='1' height='1' src='http://slashdot.feedsportal.com/c/35028/f/647410/s/42076f3b/sc/15/mf.gif' border='0'/><br clear='all'/><br/><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443495514/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42076f3b/sc/15/rc/1/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443495514/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42076f3b/sc/15/rc/1/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443495514/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42076f3b/sc/15/rc/2/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443495514/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42076f3b/sc/15/rc/2/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443495514/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42076f3b/sc/15/rc/3/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443495514/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42076f3b/sc/15/rc/3/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443495514/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42076f3b/sc/15/a2.htm\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443495514/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42076f3b/sc/15/a2.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/216443495514/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42076f3b/sc/15/a2t.img\" border=\"0\"/><img src=\"//feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~4/P7yscTRTl4c\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>"}, {:title=>"Who's Responsible When Your Semi-Autonomous Shopping Bot Purchases Drugs Online?", :link=>"http://rss.slashdot.org/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~3/TrI35MEWo5E/story01.htm", :summary=>"Nerval's Lobster writes Who's responsible when a bot breaks the law? A collective of Swiss artists faced that very question when they coded the Random Darknet Shopper, an online shopping bot, to purchase random items from a marketplace located on the Deep Web, an area of the World Wide Web not indexed by search engines. While many of the 16,000 items for sale on this marketplace are legal, quite a few are not; and when the bot used its $100-per-week-in-Bitcoin to purchase a handful of illegal pills and a fake Hungarian passport, the artists found themselves in one of those conundrums unique to the 21st century: Is one liable when a bunch of semi-autonomous code goes off and does something bad? In a short piece in The Guardian, the artists seemed prepared to face the legal consequences of their software's actions, but nothing had happened yet&mdash;even though the gallery displaying the items is reportedly next door to a police station. In addition to the drugs and passport, the bot ordered a box set of The Lord of the Rings, a Louis Vuitton handbag, a couple of cartons of Chesterfield Blue cigarettes, sneakers, knockoff jeans, and much more.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\"> <a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Who's+Responsible+When+Your+Semi-Autonomous+Shopping+Bot+Purchases+Drugs+Online%3F%3A+http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1vUybpn\"><img src=\"http://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a> <a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftech.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F15%2F01%2F05%2F1854222%2Fwhos-responsible-when-your-semi-autonomous-shopping-bot-purchases-drugs-online%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"http://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a> <a class=\"nobg\" href=\"http://plus.google.com/share?url=http://tech.slashdot.org/story/15/01/05/1854222/whos-responsible-when-your-semi-autonomous-shopping-bot-purchases-drugs-online?utm_source=slashdot&amp;utm_medium=googleplus\" onclick=\"javascript:window.open(this.href,'', 'menubar=no,toolbar=no,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes,height=600,width=600');return false;\"><img src=\"http://www.gstatic.com/images/icons/gplus-16.png\" alt=\"Share on Google+\"/></a> </div></p><p><a href=\"http://tech.slashdot.org/story/15/01/05/1854222/whos-responsible-when-your-semi-autonomous-shopping-bot-purchases-drugs-online?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"http://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=6635865&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe><img width='1' height='1' src='http://slashdot.feedsportal.com/c/35028/f/647410/s/420728a8/sc/36/mf.gif' border='0'/><br clear='all'/><br/><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443556503/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/420728a8/sc/36/rc/1/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443556503/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/420728a8/sc/36/rc/1/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443556503/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/420728a8/sc/36/rc/2/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443556503/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/420728a8/sc/36/rc/2/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443556503/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/420728a8/sc/36/rc/3/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443556503/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/420728a8/sc/36/rc/3/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443556503/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/420728a8/sc/36/a2.htm\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443556503/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/420728a8/sc/36/a2.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/216443556503/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/420728a8/sc/36/a2t.img\" border=\"0\"/><img src=\"//feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~4/TrI35MEWo5E\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>"}, {:title=>"FCC Revamps Customer Complaint System", :link=>"http://rss.slashdot.org/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~3/MyrFnYqnJT4/story01.htm", :summary=>"blottsie writes The FCC has heard your complaints, and it's finally going to make it easier to file more complaints.

Some 75 percent of respondents in countries classified as \"free,\" 84 percent in \"partly free\" countries, and 80 percent in countries that were \"not free\" said that they were \"very\" or \"somewhat\" worried about government surveillance in their countries. The survey, which will be released Monday, was conducted anonymously online in fall 2014 and yielded 772 responses from fiction and nonfiction writers and related professionals, including translators and editors, in 50 countries.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\"> <a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Writers+Say+They+Feel+Censored+By+Surveillance%3A+http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1Ax1Tad\"><img src=\"http://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a> <a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fyro.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F15%2F01%2F05%2F1445202%2Fwriters-say-they-feel-censored-by-surveillance%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"http://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a> <a class=\"nobg\" href=\"http://plus.google.com/share?url=http://yro.slashdot.org/story/15/01/05/1445202/writers-say-they-feel-censored-by-surveillance?utm_source=slashdot&amp;utm_medium=googleplus\" onclick=\"javascript:window.open(this.href,'', 'menubar=no,toolbar=no,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes,height=600,width=600');return false;\"><img src=\"http://www.gstatic.com/images/icons/gplus-16.png\" alt=\"Share on Google+\"/></a> </div></p><p><a href=\"http://yro.slashdot.org/story/15/01/05/1445202/writers-say-they-feel-censored-by-surveillance?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"http://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=6634599&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe><img width='1' height='1' src='http://slashdot.feedsportal.com/c/35028/f/647410/s/42069bcd/sc/1/mf.gif' border='0'/><br clear='all'/><br/><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443505850/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42069bcd/sc/1/rc/1/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443505850/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42069bcd/sc/1/rc/1/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443505850/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42069bcd/sc/1/rc/2/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443505850/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42069bcd/sc/1/rc/2/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443505850/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42069bcd/sc/1/rc/3/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443505850/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42069bcd/sc/1/rc/3/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443505850/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42069bcd/sc/1/a2.htm\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443505850/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42069bcd/sc/1/a2.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/216443505850/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42069bcd/sc/1/a2t.img\" border=\"0\"/><img src=\"//feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~4/y6gYQW8E9G4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>"}, {:title=>"In Daring Plan, Tomorrow SpaceX To Land a Rocket On Floating Platform", :link=>"http://rss.slashdot.org/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~3/ageOWXQZR24/story01.htm", :summary=>"HughPickens.com writes \"The cost of getting to orbit is exorbitant, because the rocket, with its multimillion-dollar engines, ends up as trash in the ocean after one launching, something Elon Musk likens to throwing away a 747 jet after a single transcontinental flight. That's why tomorrow morning at 620 am his company hopes to upend the economics of space travel in a daring plan by attempting to land the first stage of a Falcon 9 rocket intact on a floating platform, 300 feet long and 170 feet wide in the Atlantic Ocean. SpaceX has attempted similar maneuvers on three earlier Falcon 9 flights, and on the second and third attempts, the rocket slowed to a hover before splashing into the water. \"We've been able to soft-land the rocket booster in the ocean twice so far,\" says Musk. \"Unfortunately, it sort of sat there for several seconds, then tipped over and exploded. It's quite difficult to reuse at that point.\" After the booster falls away and the second stage continues pushing the payload to orbit, its engines will reignite to turn it around and guide it to a spot about 200 miles east of Jacksonville, Florida. Musk puts the chances of success at 50 percent or less but over the dozen or so flights scheduled for this year, \"I think it's quite likely, 80 to 90 percent likely, that one of those flights will be able to land and refly.\" SpaceX will offer its own launch webcast on the company's website beginning at 6 a.m. If SpaceX's gamble succeeds, the company plans to reuse the rocket stage on a later flight. \"Reusability is the critical breakthrough needed in rocketry to take things to the next level.\" SpaceX announced the plan in December.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\"> <a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=In+Daring+Plan%2C+Tomorrow+SpaceX+To+Land+a+Rocket+On+Floating+Platform%3A+http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F14pYT3o\"><img src=\"http://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a> <a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fscience.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F15%2F01%2F05%2F172259%2Fin-daring-plan-tomorrow-spacex-to-land-a-rocket-on-floating-platform%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"http://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a> <a class=\"nobg\" href=\"http://plus.google.com/share?url=http://science.slashdot.org/story/15/01/05/172259/in-daring-plan-tomorrow-spacex-to-land-a-rocket-on-floating-platform?utm_source=slashdot&amp;utm_medium=googleplus\" onclick=\"javascript:window.open(this.href,'', 'menubar=no,toolbar=no,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes,height=600,width=600');return false;\"><img src=\"http://www.gstatic.com/images/icons/gplus-16.png\" alt=\"Share on Google+\"/></a> </div></p><p><a href=\"http://science.slashdot.org/story/15/01/05/172259/in-daring-plan-tomorrow-spacex-to-land-a-rocket-on-floating-platform?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"http://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=6635389&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe><img width='1' height='1' src='http://slashdot.feedsportal.com/c/35028/f/647410/s/42065f07/sc/36/mf.gif' border='0'/><br clear='all'/><br/><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443490911/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42065f07/sc/36/rc/1/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443490911/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42065f07/sc/36/rc/1/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443490911/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42065f07/sc/36/rc/2/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443490911/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42065f07/sc/36/rc/2/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443490911/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42065f07/sc/36/rc/3/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443490911/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42065f07/sc/36/rc/3/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443490911/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42065f07/sc/36/a2.htm\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443490911/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42065f07/sc/36/a2.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/216443490911/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42065f07/sc/36/a2t.img\" border=\"0\"/><img src=\"//feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~4/ageOWXQZR24\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>"}, {:title=>"Nest Will Now Work With Your Door Locks, Light Bulbs and More", :link=>"http://rss.slashdot.org/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~3/HO-YCFBB_Mo/story01.htm", :summary=>"An anonymous reader writes with news about 15 new brand partnerships Nest announced today. \"When Google purchased Nest Labs &ndash; the maker of Internet-connected thermostats and smoke detectors &ndash; the search engine giant saw the potential to create a software platform for controlling the myriad everyday devices and gadgets in consumers' homes, a central hub for the so-called \"Internet of things.\" This vision took a major step towards becoming reality Monday morning, when Nest announced at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas that 15 new partners were joining its \"Works with Nest\" developer program.

In a blog post, he writes, \"Apple's hardware today is amazing &mdash; it has never been better. But the software quality has taken such a nosedive in the last few years that I'm deeply concerned for its future.\" Arment was CTO at Tumblr, before he left to start Instapaper. \"Apple has completely lost the functional high ground,\" says Arment. \"'It just works' was never completely true, but I don't think the list of qualifiers and asterisks has ever been longer.\" He blames Apple prioritizing marketing for the problems with Apple's software. Apple wants to have new software releases each year as a marketing hook, but the annual cycles of updating Apple's software are leading to too many bugs and problems, he says: I suspect the rapid decline of Apple's software is a sign that marketing has a bit too much power at Apple today: the marketing priority of having major new releases every year is clearly impossible for the engineering teams to keep up with while maintaining quality. Maybe it's an engineering problem, but I suspect not &mdash; I doubt that any cohesive engineering team could keep up with these demands and maintain significantly higher quality.\"<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\"> <a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Tumblr+Co-Founder%3A+Apple's+Software+Is+In+a+Nosedive%3A+http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1wcAJjR\"><img src=\"http://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a> <a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fapple.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F15%2F01%2F05%2F152238%2Ftumblr-co-founder-apples-software-is-in-a-nosedive%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"http://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a> <a class=\"nobg\" href=\"http://plus.google.com/share?url=http://apple.slashdot.org/story/15/01/05/152238/tumblr-co-founder-apples-software-is-in-a-nosedive?utm_source=slashdot&amp;utm_medium=googleplus\" onclick=\"javascript:window.open(this.href,'', 'menubar=no,toolbar=no,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes,height=600,width=600');return false;\"><img src=\"http://www.gstatic.com/images/icons/gplus-16.png\" alt=\"Share on Google+\"/></a> </div></p><p><a href=\"http://apple.slashdot.org/story/15/01/05/152238/tumblr-co-founder-apples-software-is-in-a-nosedive?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"http://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=6634719&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe><img width='1' height='1' src='http://slashdot.feedsportal.com/c/35028/f/647410/s/42057fd3/sc/4/mf.gif' border='0'/><br clear='all'/><br/><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443501898/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42057fd3/sc/4/rc/1/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443501898/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42057fd3/sc/4/rc/1/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443501898/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42057fd3/sc/4/rc/2/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443501898/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42057fd3/sc/4/rc/2/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443501898/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42057fd3/sc/4/rc/3/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443501898/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42057fd3/sc/4/rc/3/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443501898/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42057fd3/sc/4/a2.htm\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443501898/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42057fd3/sc/4/a2.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/216443501898/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42057fd3/sc/4/a2t.img\" border=\"0\"/><img src=\"//feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~4/kLPUtKS1J64\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>"}, {:title=>"Project Ryptide Drone Flies Life-Rings To Distressed Swimmers", :link=>"http://rss.slashdot.org/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~3/-V2-6XUyYBE/story01.htm", :summary=>"Zothecula writes The speed that drones can be deployed makes them ideal for delivering items when time is of the essence. The Ambulance Drone and Defikopter, for example, are used for transporting defibrillators to those in need. Now, Project Ryptide plans to use drones to deliver life-rings to swimmers in distress. From the article: \"The project, which is at pre-production prototype stage, was conceived by Bill Piedra, a part-time teacher at the King Low Heywood Thomas (KLHT) school in Stamford, Connecticut. Piedra began working on the design in January 2014 and then began developing it further with students at KLHT in September 2014. 'Ryptide was designed so that anyone can be a lifeguard,' Piedra tells Gizmag. 'We had the casual user in mind when we designed the basic model; someone that might take their drone to the beach, boating, a lake, or even ice skating. It could be useful in the case of someone falling through the ice while skating, for example.'\"<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\"> <a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Project+Ryptide+Drone+Flies+Life-Rings+To+Distressed+Swimmers%3A+http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F14pByPz\"><img src=\"http://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a> <a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftech.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F15%2F01%2F05%2F1454252%2Fproject-ryptide-drone-flies-life-rings-to-distressed-swimmers%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"http://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a> <a class=\"nobg\" href=\"http://plus.google.com/share?url=http://tech.slashdot.org/story/15/01/05/1454252/project-ryptide-drone-flies-life-rings-to-distressed-swimmers?utm_source=slashdot&amp;utm_medium=googleplus\" onclick=\"javascript:window.open(this.href,'', 'menubar=no,toolbar=no,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes,height=600,width=600');return false;\"><img src=\"http://www.gstatic.com/images/icons/gplus-16.png\" alt=\"Share on Google+\"/></a> </div></p><p><a href=\"http://tech.slashdot.org/story/15/01/05/1454252/project-ryptide-drone-flies-life-rings-to-distressed-swimmers?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"http://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=6634683&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe><img width='1' height='1' src='http://slashdot.feedsportal.com/c/35028/f/647410/s/42057862/sc/4/mf.gif' border='0'/><br clear='all'/><br/><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443500908/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42057862/sc/4/rc/1/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443500908/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42057862/sc/4/rc/1/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443500908/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42057862/sc/4/rc/2/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443500908/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42057862/sc/4/rc/2/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443500908/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42057862/sc/4/rc/3/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443500908/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42057862/sc/4/rc/3/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443500908/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42057862/sc/4/a2.htm\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443500908/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42057862/sc/4/a2.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/216443500908/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42057862/sc/4/a2t.img\" border=\"0\"/><img src=\"//feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~4/-V2-6XUyYBE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>"}, {:title=>"Bitstamp Bitcoin Exchange Suspended Due To \"Compromised Wallet\"", :link=>"http://rss.slashdot.org/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~3/qo7NOL4oJJQ/story01.htm", :summary=>"twitnutttt writes Customers of Bistamp, the successor (until recently) to MtGox as the highest-volume dollar-denominated Bitcoin exchange, and still the preferred source of trading data for many technical analysts, sent an email at about 4:00 UTC today warning that, \"Today our transaction processing server detected problems with our hot wallet and stopped processing withdrawals.\" They also instructed users to stop sending any deposits immediately or they may be lost.

The software giant calls it its \"most affordable Internet-ready entry-level phone yet\", costing just $29.\"<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\"> <a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Microsoft+Unveils+Nokia+215%2C+a+%2429+Phone+With+Internet+Access%3A+http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1xKp7Hv\"><img src=\"http://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a> <a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fmobile.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F15%2F01%2F05%2F1241215%2Fmicrosoft-unveils-nokia-215-a-29-phone-with-internet-access%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"http://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a> <a class=\"nobg\" href=\"http://plus.google.com/share?url=http://mobile.slashdot.org/story/15/01/05/1241215/microsoft-unveils-nokia-215-a-29-phone-with-internet-access?utm_source=slashdot&amp;utm_medium=googleplus\" onclick=\"javascript:window.open(this.href,'', 'menubar=no,toolbar=no,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes,height=600,width=600');return false;\"><img src=\"http://www.gstatic.com/images/icons/gplus-16.png\" alt=\"Share on Google+\"/></a> </div></p><p><a href=\"http://mobile.slashdot.org/story/15/01/05/1241215/microsoft-unveils-nokia-215-a-29-phone-with-internet-access?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"http://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=6633293&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe><img width='1' height='1' src='http://slashdot.feedsportal.com/c/35028/f/647410/s/4204787f/sc/5/mf.gif' border='0'/><br clear='all'/><br/><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443553784/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/4204787f/sc/5/rc/1/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443553784/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/4204787f/sc/5/rc/1/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443553784/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/4204787f/sc/5/rc/2/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443553784/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/4204787f/sc/5/rc/2/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443553784/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/4204787f/sc/5/rc/3/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443553784/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/4204787f/sc/5/rc/3/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443553784/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/4204787f/sc/5/a2.htm\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443553784/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/4204787f/sc/5/a2.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/216443553784/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/4204787f/sc/5/a2t.img\" border=\"0\"/><img src=\"//feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~4/kboUxJuK5CM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>"}, {:title=>"NVIDIA Announces Tegra X1 Chip and Drive CX and PX Automotive Platforms", :link=>"http://rss.slashdot.org/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~3/e7PTuh3qiVQ/story01.htm", :summary=>"MojoKid writes For the last few years, NVIDIA has taken advantage of the lead-up to the Consumer Electronics Show to announce new Tegra-powered mobile architectures and this year we're being treated to more of the same. Today, NVIDIA unveiled its upcoming Tegra X1 system on a chip (SoC) and a few automotive computer systems leveraging the chip. Tegra X1 is a significant departure from the previous-gen Tegra K1 in that it features a 256 core Maxwell-derived GPU and eight CPU cores; four ARM A57 cores and four A53s in a big.LITTLE configuration. NVIDIA claims the Tegra X1 offers up to 2x the performance of the Tegra K1 in a similar power envelope, thanks to improved efficiency in the CPU and GPU cores and because the chips will be built using TSMC's 20nm manufacturing process. In addition to the Tegra X1 itself, NVIDIA also announced some new automotive computing platforms, the NVIDIA Drive CX Digital Cockpit Computer and Drive PX Auto-Pilot Platform, along with the Drive Studio software suite for developing in-car infotainment systems and autonomous driving systems.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\"> <a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=NVIDIA+Announces+Tegra+X1+Chip+and+Drive+CX+and+PX+Automotive+Platforms%3A+http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1yrzX8f\"><img src=\"http://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a> <a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fhardware.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F15%2F01%2F05%2F1231242%2Fnvidia-announces-tegra-x1-chip-and-drive-cx-and-px-automotive-platforms%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"http://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a> <a class=\"nobg\" href=\"http://plus.google.com/share?url=http://hardware.slashdot.org/story/15/01/05/1231242/nvidia-announces-tegra-x1-chip-and-drive-cx-and-px-automotive-platforms?utm_source=slashdot&amp;utm_medium=googleplus\" onclick=\"javascript:window.open(this.href,'', 'menubar=no,toolbar=no,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes,height=600,width=600');return false;\"><img src=\"http://www.gstatic.com/images/icons/gplus-16.png\" alt=\"Share on Google+\"/></a> </div></p><p><a href=\"http://hardware.slashdot.org/story/15/01/05/1231242/nvidia-announces-tegra-x1-chip-and-drive-cx-and-px-automotive-platforms?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"http://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=6633127&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe><img width='1' height='1' src='http://slashdot.feedsportal.com/c/35028/f/647410/s/42043910/sc/23/mf.gif' border='0'/><br clear='all'/><br/><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443494877/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42043910/sc/23/rc/1/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443494877/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42043910/sc/23/rc/1/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443494877/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42043910/sc/23/rc/2/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443494877/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42043910/sc/23/rc/2/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443494877/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42043910/sc/23/rc/3/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443494877/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42043910/sc/23/rc/3/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443494877/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42043910/sc/23/a2.htm\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443494877/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42043910/sc/23/a2.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/216443494877/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42043910/sc/23/a2t.img\" border=\"0\"/><img src=\"//feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~4/e7PTuh3qiVQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>"}, {:title=>"Ancient Planes and Other Claims Spark Controversy at Indian Science Congress", :link=>"http://rss.slashdot.org/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~3/rK1uqj4A88I/story01.htm", :summary=>"An anonymous reader writes A paper presented at the 102nd Indian Science Congress on Sunday claims that Indians had mastered aviation thousands of years before the Wright brothers.

OP was forced to open a helpline for customers unable to confirm payments or transfer money because of jammed systems. On Saturday the firm said it would compensate people for any losses or late payment fees incurred as a result of attack. On Sunday morning the bank tweeted that its services were operating normally and even customers based outside Finland were able to access their accounts &mdash; and that it was still monitoring traffic carefully to try and ward off any renewed strikes. However, on Sunday afternoon further denial of service attacks took place delaying payments and preventing access to banking services for OP customers.

But Dish has hinted that there may be limits on watching ESPN on mobile thanks to red tape from existing deals between the network and Verizon.\"<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\"> <a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Dish+Introduces+%2420-a-Month+Streaming-TV+Service%3A+http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1ytwGVV\"><img src=\"http://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a> <a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fentertainment.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F15%2F01%2F05%2F2115219%2Fdish-introduces-20-a-month-streaming-tv-service%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"http://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a> <a class=\"nobg\" href=\"http://plus.google.com/share?url=http://entertainment.slashdot.org/story/15/01/05/2115219/dish-introduces-20-a-month-streaming-tv-service?utm_source=slashdot&amp;utm_medium=googleplus\" onclick=\"javascript:window.open(this.href,'', 'menubar=no,toolbar=no,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes,height=600,width=600');return false;\"><img src=\"http://www.gstatic.com/images/icons/gplus-16.png\" alt=\"Share on Google+\"/></a> </div></p><p><a href=\"http://entertainment.slashdot.org/story/15/01/05/2115219/dish-introduces-20-a-month-streaming-tv-service?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"http://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=6636221&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe><img width='1' height='1' src='http://slashdot.feedsportal.com/c/35028/f/647410/s/420776b9/sc/21/mf.gif' border='0'/><br clear='all'/><br/><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443496498/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/420776b9/sc/21/rc/1/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443496498/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/420776b9/sc/21/rc/1/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443496498/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/420776b9/sc/21/rc/2/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443496498/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/420776b9/sc/21/rc/2/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443496498/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/420776b9/sc/21/rc/3/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443496498/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/420776b9/sc/21/rc/3/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443496498/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/420776b9/sc/21/a2.htm\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443496498/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/420776b9/sc/21/a2.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/216443496498/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/420776b9/sc/21/a2t.img\" border=\"0\"/><img src=\"//feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~4/9bdaGnRLKn0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>"}, {:title=>"Ebola Wipes Out Every Mother in Liberian Village (bioethicscom)", :link=>"http://news.feedzilla.com/en_us/stories/science/413762791?client_source=api&format=json", :summary=>"(The Telegraph) - For 11-year-old Montgomery Philip, childhood is over.

The attack, which investigators said was launched from both Finland and abroad, began on New Year's Eve. OP was forced to open a helpline for customers unable to confirm payments or transfer money because of jammed systems. On Saturday the firm said it would compensate people for any losses or late payment fees incurred as a result of attack. On Sunday morning the bank tweeted that its services were operating normally and even customers based outside Finland were able to access their accounts &mdash; and that it was still monitoring traffic carefully to try and ward off any renewed strikes. However, on Sunday afternoon further denial of service attacks took place delaying payments and preventing access to banking services for OP customers.

That's why tomorrow morning at 620 am his company hopes to upend the economics of space travel in a daring plan by attempting to land the first stage of a Falcon 9 rocket intact on a floating platform, 300 feet long and 170 feet wide in the Atlantic Ocean. SpaceX has attempted similar maneuvers on three earlier Falcon 9 flights, and on the second and third attempts, the rocket slowed to a hover before splashing into the water. \"We've been able to soft-land the rocket booster in the ocean twice so far,\" says Musk. \"Unfortunately, it sort of sat there for several seconds, then tipped over and exploded. It's quite difficult to reuse at that point.\" After the booster falls away and the second stage continues pushing the payload to orbit, its engines will reignite to turn it around and guide it to a spot about 200 miles east of Jacksonville, Florida. Musk puts the chances of success at 50 percent or less but over the dozen or so flights scheduled for this year, \"I think it's quite likely, 80 to 90 percent likely, that one of those flights will be able to land and refly.\" SpaceX will offer its own launch webcast on the company's website beginning at 6 a.m. If SpaceX's gamble succeeds, the company plans to reuse the rocket stage on a later flight. \"Reusability is the critical breakthrough needed in rocketry to take things to the next level.\" SpaceX announced the plan in December.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\"> <a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=In+Daring+Plan%2C+Tomorrow+SpaceX+To+Land+a+Rocket+On+Floating+Platform%3A+http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F14pYT3o\"><img src=\"http://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a> <a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fscience.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F15%2F01%2F05%2F172259%2Fin-daring-plan-tomorrow-spacex-to-land-a-rocket-on-floating-platform%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"http://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a> <a class=\"nobg\" href=\"http://plus.google.com/share?url=http://science.slashdot.org/story/15/01/05/172259/in-daring-plan-tomorrow-spacex-to-land-a-rocket-on-floating-platform?utm_source=slashdot&amp;utm_medium=googleplus\" onclick=\"javascript:window.open(this.href,'', 'menubar=no,toolbar=no,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes,height=600,width=600');return false;\"><img src=\"http://www.gstatic.com/images/icons/gplus-16.png\" alt=\"Share on Google+\"/></a> </div></p><p><a href=\"http://science.slashdot.org/story/15/01/05/172259/in-daring-plan-tomorrow-spacex-to-land-a-rocket-on-floating-platform?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"http://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=6635389&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe><img width='1' height='1' src='http://slashdot.feedsportal.com/c/35028/f/647410/s/42065f07/sc/36/mf.gif' border='0'/><br clear='all'/><br/><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443490911/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42065f07/sc/36/rc/1/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443490911/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42065f07/sc/36/rc/1/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443490911/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42065f07/sc/36/rc/2/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443490911/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42065f07/sc/36/rc/2/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443490911/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42065f07/sc/36/rc/3/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443490911/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42065f07/sc/36/rc/3/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443490911/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42065f07/sc/36/a2.htm\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443490911/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42065f07/sc/36/a2.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/216443490911/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42065f07/sc/36/a2t.img\" border=\"0\"/><img src=\"//feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~4/ageOWXQZR24\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>"}, {:title=>"Inside Amsterdam's Efforts To Become a Smart City", :link=>"http://rss.slashdot.org/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~3/bSBcM-WzRrE/story01.htm", :summary=>"First time accepted submitter MollsEisley writes Throughout Amsterdam there are \"Living Labs,\" or communities that act as petri dishes for ideas and initiatives to be tested before scaling them across the city.

This new SoC is a \"tick\" in Intel's tick-tock plan, which means it's mostly a die shrink of the existing Haswell architecture, at least on the CPU side. On the GPU side, there's a bevy of improvements and advances, and the video decoder block has been beefed up with dual bit stream decoders in its high-end (GT3) hardware. Other feature improvements and capabilities are expected, though Intel has been quiet on exactly what they have tweaked and changed to date. Intel is claiming that the architecture will boost battery life by 1.5 hours, speed video conversions, and offer a whopping 22% improvement to 3D performance &mdash; a gain on par with what we saw when moving from Ivy Bridge to Haswell. Intel also took the wraps off their next gen Atom CPU, code named Cherry Trail. This is essentially a 14nm Bay Trail die shrink that's been on the roadmap for a while. As with Haswell-Broadwell, the Bay Trail-Cherry Trail shift is aimed at improving CPU power consumption and overall SoC power characteristics, though again, we'll see an updated GPU baked in as well.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\"> <a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Intel+Unveils+5th+Gen+Core+Series+Broadwell-U+CPUs+and+Cherry+Trail+Atom%3A+http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1Apsiph\"><img src=\"http://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a> <a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fhardware.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F15%2F01%2F05%2F1844225%2Fintel-unveils-5th-gen-core-series-broadwell-u-cpus-and-cherry-trail-atom%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"http://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a> <a class=\"nobg\" href=\"http://plus.google.com/share?url=http://hardware.slashdot.org/story/15/01/05/1844225/intel-unveils-5th-gen-core-series-broadwell-u-cpus-and-cherry-trail-atom?utm_source=slashdot&amp;utm_medium=googleplus\" onclick=\"javascript:window.open(this.href,'', 'menubar=no,toolbar=no,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes,height=600,width=600');return false;\"><img src=\"http://www.gstatic.com/images/icons/gplus-16.png\" alt=\"Share on Google+\"/></a> </div></p><p><a href=\"http://hardware.slashdot.org/story/15/01/05/1844225/intel-unveils-5th-gen-core-series-broadwell-u-cpus-and-cherry-trail-atom?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"http://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=6635815&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe><img width='1' height='1' src='http://slashdot.feedsportal.com/c/35028/f/647410/s/42076f3b/sc/15/mf.gif' border='0'/><br clear='all'/><br/><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443495514/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42076f3b/sc/15/rc/1/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443495514/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42076f3b/sc/15/rc/1/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443495514/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42076f3b/sc/15/rc/2/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443495514/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42076f3b/sc/15/rc/2/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443495514/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42076f3b/sc/15/rc/3/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443495514/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42076f3b/sc/15/rc/3/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443495514/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42076f3b/sc/15/a2.htm\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443495514/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42076f3b/sc/15/a2.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/216443495514/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42076f3b/sc/15/a2t.img\" border=\"0\"/><img src=\"//feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~4/P7yscTRTl4c\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>"}, {:title=>"Interviews: Ask Alexander Stepanov and Daniel E.

The software giant calls it its \"most affordable Internet-ready entry-level phone yet\", costing just $29.\"<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\"> <a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Microsoft+Unveils+Nokia+215%2C+a+%2429+Phone+With+Internet+Access%3A+http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1xKp7Hv\"><img src=\"http://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a> <a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fmobile.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F15%2F01%2F05%2F1241215%2Fmicrosoft-unveils-nokia-215-a-29-phone-with-internet-access%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"http://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a> <a class=\"nobg\" href=\"http://plus.google.com/share?url=http://mobile.slashdot.org/story/15/01/05/1241215/microsoft-unveils-nokia-215-a-29-phone-with-internet-access?utm_source=slashdot&amp;utm_medium=googleplus\" onclick=\"javascript:window.open(this.href,'', 'menubar=no,toolbar=no,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes,height=600,width=600');return false;\"><img src=\"http://www.gstatic.com/images/icons/gplus-16.png\" alt=\"Share on Google+\"/></a> </div></p><p><a href=\"http://mobile.slashdot.org/story/15/01/05/1241215/microsoft-unveils-nokia-215-a-29-phone-with-internet-access?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"http://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=6633293&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe><img width='1' height='1' src='http://slashdot.feedsportal.com/c/35028/f/647410/s/4204787f/sc/5/mf.gif' border='0'/><br clear='all'/><br/><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443553784/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/4204787f/sc/5/rc/1/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443553784/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/4204787f/sc/5/rc/1/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443553784/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/4204787f/sc/5/rc/2/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443553784/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/4204787f/sc/5/rc/2/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443553784/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/4204787f/sc/5/rc/3/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443553784/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/4204787f/sc/5/rc/3/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443553784/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/4204787f/sc/5/a2.htm\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443553784/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/4204787f/sc/5/a2.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/216443553784/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/4204787f/sc/5/a2t.img\" border=\"0\"/><img src=\"//feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~4/kboUxJuK5CM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>"}, {:title=>"NVIDIA Announces Tegra X1 Chip and Drive CX and PX Automotive Platforms", :link=>"http://rss.slashdot.org/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~3/e7PTuh3qiVQ/story01.htm", :summary=>"MojoKid writes For the last few years, NVIDIA has taken advantage of the lead-up to the Consumer Electronics Show to announce new Tegra-powered mobile architectures and this year we're being treated to more of the same. Today, NVIDIA unveiled its upcoming Tegra X1 system on a chip (SoC) and a few automotive computer systems leveraging the chip. Tegra X1 is a significant departure from the previous-gen Tegra K1 in that it features a 256 core Maxwell-derived GPU and eight CPU cores; four ARM A57 cores and four A53s in a big.LITTLE configuration. NVIDIA claims the Tegra X1 offers up to 2x the performance of the Tegra K1 in a similar power envelope, thanks to improved efficiency in the CPU and GPU cores and because the chips will be built using TSMC's 20nm manufacturing process. In addition to the Tegra X1 itself, NVIDIA also announced some new automotive computing platforms, the NVIDIA Drive CX Digital Cockpit Computer and Drive PX Auto-Pilot Platform, along with the Drive Studio software suite for developing in-car infotainment systems and autonomous driving systems.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\"> <a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=NVIDIA+Announces+Tegra+X1+Chip+and+Drive+CX+and+PX+Automotive+Platforms%3A+http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1yrzX8f\"><img src=\"http://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a> <a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fhardware.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F15%2F01%2F05%2F1231242%2Fnvidia-announces-tegra-x1-chip-and-drive-cx-and-px-automotive-platforms%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"http://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a> <a class=\"nobg\" href=\"http://plus.google.com/share?url=http://hardware.slashdot.org/story/15/01/05/1231242/nvidia-announces-tegra-x1-chip-and-drive-cx-and-px-automotive-platforms?utm_source=slashdot&amp;utm_medium=googleplus\" onclick=\"javascript:window.open(this.href,'', 'menubar=no,toolbar=no,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes,height=600,width=600');return false;\"><img src=\"http://www.gstatic.com/images/icons/gplus-16.png\" alt=\"Share on Google+\"/></a> </div></p><p><a href=\"http://hardware.slashdot.org/story/15/01/05/1231242/nvidia-announces-tegra-x1-chip-and-drive-cx-and-px-automotive-platforms?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"http://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=6633127&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe><img width='1' height='1' src='http://slashdot.feedsportal.com/c/35028/f/647410/s/42043910/sc/23/mf.gif' border='0'/><br clear='all'/><br/><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443494877/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42043910/sc/23/rc/1/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443494877/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42043910/sc/23/rc/1/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443494877/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42043910/sc/23/rc/2/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443494877/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42043910/sc/23/rc/2/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443494877/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42043910/sc/23/rc/3/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443494877/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42043910/sc/23/rc/3/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443494877/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42043910/sc/23/a2.htm\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443494877/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42043910/sc/23/a2.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/216443494877/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42043910/sc/23/a2t.img\" border=\"0\"/><img src=\"//feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~4/e7PTuh3qiVQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>"}, {:title=>"Nest Will Now Work With Your Door Locks, Light Bulbs and More", :link=>"http://rss.slashdot.org/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~3/HO-YCFBB_Mo/story01.htm", :summary=>"An anonymous reader writes with news about 15 new brand partnerships Nest announced today. \"When Google purchased Nest Labs &ndash; the maker of Internet-connected thermostats and smoke detectors &ndash; the search engine giant saw the potential to create a software platform for controlling the myriad everyday devices and gadgets in consumers' homes, a central hub for the so-called \"Internet of things.\" This vision took a major step towards becoming reality Monday morning, when Nest announced at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas that 15 new partners were joining its \"Works with Nest\" developer program.

From the article: \"The project, which is at pre-production prototype stage, was conceived by Bill Piedra, a part-time teacher at the King Low Heywood Thomas (KLHT) school in Stamford, Connecticut. Piedra began working on the design in January 2014 and then began developing it further with students at KLHT in September 2014. 'Ryptide was designed so that anyone can be a lifeguard,' Piedra tells Gizmag. 'We had the casual user in mind when we designed the basic model; someone that might take their drone to the beach, boating, a lake, or even ice skating.

Apple wants to have new software releases each year as a marketing hook, but the annual cycles of updating Apple's software are leading to too many bugs and problems, he says: I suspect the rapid decline of Apple's software is a sign that marketing has a bit too much power at Apple today: the marketing priority of having major new releases every year is clearly impossible for the engineering teams to keep up with while maintaining quality.

A collective of Swiss artists faced that very question when they coded the Random Darknet Shopper, an online shopping bot, to purchase random items from a marketplace located on the Deep Web, an area of the World Wide Web not indexed by search engines. While many of the 16,000 items for sale on this marketplace are legal, quite a few are not; and when the bot used its $100-per-week-in-Bitcoin to purchase a handful of illegal pills and a fake Hungarian passport, the artists found themselves in one of those conundrums unique to the 21st century: Is one liable when a bunch of semi-autonomous code goes off and does something bad? In a short piece in The Guardian, the artists seemed prepared to face the legal consequences of their software's actions, but nothing had happened yet&mdash;even though the gallery displaying the items is reportedly next door to a police station. In addition to the drugs and passport, the bot ordered a box set of The Lord of the Rings, a Louis Vuitton handbag, a couple of cartons of Chesterfield Blue cigarettes, sneakers, knockoff jeans, and much more.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\"> <a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Who's+Responsible+When+Your+Semi-Autonomous+Shopping+Bot+Purchases+Drugs+Online%3F%3A+http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1vUybpn\"><img src=\"http://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a> <a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftech.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F15%2F01%2F05%2F1854222%2Fwhos-responsible-when-your-semi-autonomous-shopping-bot-purchases-drugs-online%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"http://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a> <a class=\"nobg\" href=\"http://plus.google.com/share?url=http://tech.slashdot.org/story/15/01/05/1854222/whos-responsible-when-your-semi-autonomous-shopping-bot-purchases-drugs-online?utm_source=slashdot&amp;utm_medium=googleplus\" onclick=\"javascript:window.open(this.href,'', 'menubar=no,toolbar=no,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes,height=600,width=600');return false;\"><img src=\"http://www.gstatic.com/images/icons/gplus-16.png\" alt=\"Share on Google+\"/></a> </div></p><p><a href=\"http://tech.slashdot.org/story/15/01/05/1854222/whos-responsible-when-your-semi-autonomous-shopping-bot-purchases-drugs-online?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"http://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=6635865&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe><img width='1' height='1' src='http://slashdot.feedsportal.com/c/35028/f/647410/s/420728a8/sc/36/mf.gif' border='0'/><br clear='all'/><br/><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443556503/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/420728a8/sc/36/rc/1/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443556503/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/420728a8/sc/36/rc/1/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443556503/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/420728a8/sc/36/rc/2/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443556503/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/420728a8/sc/36/rc/2/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443556503/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/420728a8/sc/36/rc/3/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443556503/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/420728a8/sc/36/rc/3/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443556503/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/420728a8/sc/36/a2.htm\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443556503/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/420728a8/sc/36/a2.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/216443556503/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/420728a8/sc/36/a2t.img\" border=\"0\"/><img src=\"//feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~4/TrI35MEWo5E\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>"}, {:title=>"With 1 Million Papers, Preprint Site Is Changing the Way Science Is Shared (Scientific American)", :link=>"http://news.feedzilla.com/en_us/stories/science/413790560?client_source=api&format=json", :summary=>"Researchers upload papers to arXiv before peer review for faster feedback\n\n\n-- Read more on ScientificAmerican.com\n\n"}, {:title=>"Writers Say They Feel Censored By Surveillance", :link=>"http://rss.slashdot.org/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~3/y6gYQW8E9G4/story01.htm", :summary=>"schwit1 writes with news about the impact of government surveillance on authors and their work worldwide .

The findings show that writers consider freedom of expression to be under significant threat around the world in democratic and nondemocratic countries. Some 75 percent of respondents in countries classified as \"free,\" 84 percent in \"partly free\" countries, and 80 percent in countries that were \"not free\" said that they were \"very\" or \"somewhat\" worried about government surveillance in their countries. The survey, which will be released Monday, was conducted anonymously online in fall 2014 and yielded 772 responses from fiction and nonfiction writers and related professionals, including translators and editors, in 50 countries.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\"> <a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Writers+Say+They+Feel+Censored+By+Surveillance%3A+http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1Ax1Tad\"><img src=\"http://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a> <a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fyro.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F15%2F01%2F05%2F1445202%2Fwriters-say-they-feel-censored-by-surveillance%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"http://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a> <a class=\"nobg\" href=\"http://plus.google.com/share?url=http://yro.slashdot.org/story/15/01/05/1445202/writers-say-they-feel-censored-by-surveillance?utm_source=slashdot&amp;utm_medium=googleplus\" onclick=\"javascript:window.open(this.href,'', 'menubar=no,toolbar=no,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes,height=600,width=600');return false;\"><img src=\"http://www.gstatic.com/images/icons/gplus-16.png\" alt=\"Share on Google+\"/></a> </div></p><p><a href=\"http://yro.slashdot.org/story/15/01/05/1445202/writers-say-they-feel-censored-by-surveillance?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"http://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=6634599&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe><img width='1' height='1' src='http://slashdot.feedsportal.com/c/35028/f/647410/s/42069bcd/sc/1/mf.gif' border='0'/><br clear='all'/><br/><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443505850/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42069bcd/sc/1/rc/1/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443505850/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42069bcd/sc/1/rc/1/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443505850/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42069bcd/sc/1/rc/2/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443505850/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42069bcd/sc/1/rc/2/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443505850/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42069bcd/sc/1/rc/3/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443505850/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42069bcd/sc/1/rc/3/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443505850/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42069bcd/sc/1/a2.htm\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443505850/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42069bcd/sc/1/a2.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/216443505850/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42069bcd/sc/1/a2t.img\" border=\"0\"/><img src=\"//feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~4/y6gYQW8E9G4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>"}]

But it's not just the light that's important. Researchers have found that the clam has sulfur in its fleshy lips and tentacles and suspect that, like another clam species that drop tentacles laden with sulfuric acid to deter predators, the disco clam's sulfur also gets converted into a distasteful substance. The flashing may warn predators away, similar to the bright orange of a monarch butterfly warning birds of its toxic taste.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\"> <a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=%22Disco+Clam%22+Lights+Up+To+Scare+Predators+Away%3A+http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F14oLDvV\"><img src=\"http://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a> <a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fscience.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F15%2F01%2F05%2F0128243%2Fdisco-clam-lights-up-to-scare-predators-away%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"http://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a> <a class=\"nobg\" href=\"http://plus.google.com/share?url=http://science.slashdot.org/story/15/01/05/0128243/disco-clam-lights-up-to-scare-predators-away?utm_source=slashdot&amp;utm_medium=googleplus\" onclick=\"javascript:window.open(this.href,'', 'menubar=no,toolbar=no,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes,height=600,width=600');return false;\"><img src=\"http://www.gstatic.com/images/icons/gplus-16.png\" alt=\"Share on Google+\"/></a> </div></p><p><a href=\"http://science.slashdot.org/story/15/01/05/0128243/disco-clam-lights-up-to-scare-predators-away?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"http://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=6624325&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe><img width='1' height='1' src='http://slashdot.feedsportal.com/c/35028/f/647410/s/420246c5/sc/32/mf.gif' border='0'/><br clear='all'/><br/><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443478160/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/420246c5/sc/32/rc/1/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443478160/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/420246c5/sc/32/rc/1/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443478160/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/420246c5/sc/32/rc/2/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443478160/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/420246c5/sc/32/rc/2/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443478160/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/420246c5/sc/32/rc/3/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443478160/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/420246c5/sc/32/rc/3/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443478160/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/420246c5/sc/32/a2.htm\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443478160/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/420246c5/sc/32/a2.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/216443478160/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/420246c5/sc/32/a2t.img\" border=\"0\"/><img src=\"//feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~4/Zwwbe8OhPR8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>"}, {:title=>"Ancient Planes and Other Claims Spark Controversy at Indian Science Congress", :link=>"http://rss.slashdot.org/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~3/rK1uqj4A88I/story01.htm", :summary=>"An anonymous reader writes A paper presented at the 102nd Indian Science Congress on Sunday claims that Indians had mastered aviation thousands of years before the Wright brothers.

But Dish has hinted that there may be limits on watching ESPN on mobile thanks to red tape from existing deals between the network and Verizon.\"<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\"> <a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Dish+Introduces+%2420-a-Month+Streaming-TV+Service%3A+http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1ytwGVV\"><img src=\"http://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a> <a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fentertainment.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F15%2F01%2F05%2F2115219%2Fdish-introduces-20-a-month-streaming-tv-service%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"http://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a> <a class=\"nobg\" href=\"http://plus.google.com/share?url=http://entertainment.slashdot.org/story/15/01/05/2115219/dish-introduces-20-a-month-streaming-tv-service?utm_source=slashdot&amp;utm_medium=googleplus\" onclick=\"javascript:window.open(this.href,'', 'menubar=no,toolbar=no,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes,height=600,width=600');return false;\"><img src=\"http://www.gstatic.com/images/icons/gplus-16.png\" alt=\"Share on Google+\"/></a> </div></p><p><a href=\"http://entertainment.slashdot.org/story/15/01/05/2115219/dish-introduces-20-a-month-streaming-tv-service?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"http://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=6636221&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe><img width='1' height='1' src='http://slashdot.feedsportal.com/c/35028/f/647410/s/420776b9/sc/21/mf.gif' border='0'/><br clear='all'/><br/><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443496498/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/420776b9/sc/21/rc/1/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443496498/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/420776b9/sc/21/rc/1/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443496498/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/420776b9/sc/21/rc/2/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443496498/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/420776b9/sc/21/rc/2/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443496498/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/420776b9/sc/21/rc/3/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443496498/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/420776b9/sc/21/rc/3/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443496498/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/420776b9/sc/21/a2.htm\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443496498/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/420776b9/sc/21/a2.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/216443496498/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/420776b9/sc/21/a2t.img\" border=\"0\"/><img src=\"//feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~4/9bdaGnRLKn0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>"}, {:title=>"Ebola Wipes Out Every Mother in Liberian Village (bioethicscom)", :link=>"http://news.feedzilla.com/en_us/stories/science/413762791?client_source=api&format=json", :summary=>"(The Telegraph) - For 11-year-old Montgomery Philip, childhood is over.

The attack, which investigators said was launched from both Finland and abroad, began on New Year's Eve. OP was forced to open a helpline for customers unable to confirm payments or transfer money because of jammed systems. On Saturday the firm said it would compensate people for any losses or late payment fees incurred as a result of attack. On Sunday morning the bank tweeted that its services were operating normally and even customers based outside Finland were able to access their accounts &mdash; and that it was still monitoring traffic carefully to try and ward off any renewed strikes. However, on Sunday afternoon further denial of service attacks took place delaying payments and preventing access to banking services for OP customers.

That's why tomorrow morning at 620 am his company hopes to upend the economics of space travel in a daring plan by attempting to land the first stage of a Falcon 9 rocket intact on a floating platform, 300 feet long and 170 feet wide in the Atlantic Ocean. SpaceX has attempted similar maneuvers on three earlier Falcon 9 flights, and on the second and third attempts, the rocket slowed to a hover before splashing into the water. \"We've been able to soft-land the rocket booster in the ocean twice so far,\" says Musk. \"Unfortunately, it sort of sat there for several seconds, then tipped over and exploded. It's quite difficult to reuse at that point.\" After the booster falls away and the second stage continues pushing the payload to orbit, its engines will reignite to turn it around and guide it to a spot about 200 miles east of Jacksonville, Florida. Musk puts the chances of success at 50 percent or less but over the dozen or so flights scheduled for this year, \"I think it's quite likely, 80 to 90 percent likely, that one of those flights will be able to land and refly.\" SpaceX will offer its own launch webcast on the company's website beginning at 6 a.m. If SpaceX's gamble succeeds, the company plans to reuse the rocket stage on a later flight. \"Reusability is the critical breakthrough needed in rocketry to take things to the next level.\" SpaceX announced the plan in December.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\"> <a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=In+Daring+Plan%2C+Tomorrow+SpaceX+To+Land+a+Rocket+On+Floating+Platform%3A+http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F14pYT3o\"><img src=\"http://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a> <a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fscience.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F15%2F01%2F05%2F172259%2Fin-daring-plan-tomorrow-spacex-to-land-a-rocket-on-floating-platform%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"http://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a> <a class=\"nobg\" href=\"http://plus.google.com/share?url=http://science.slashdot.org/story/15/01/05/172259/in-daring-plan-tomorrow-spacex-to-land-a-rocket-on-floating-platform?utm_source=slashdot&amp;utm_medium=googleplus\" onclick=\"javascript:window.open(this.href,'', 'menubar=no,toolbar=no,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes,height=600,width=600');return false;\"><img src=\"http://www.gstatic.com/images/icons/gplus-16.png\" alt=\"Share on Google+\"/></a> </div></p><p><a href=\"http://science.slashdot.org/story/15/01/05/172259/in-daring-plan-tomorrow-spacex-to-land-a-rocket-on-floating-platform?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"http://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=6635389&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe><img width='1' height='1' src='http://slashdot.feedsportal.com/c/35028/f/647410/s/42065f07/sc/36/mf.gif' border='0'/><br clear='all'/><br/><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443490911/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42065f07/sc/36/rc/1/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443490911/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42065f07/sc/36/rc/1/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443490911/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42065f07/sc/36/rc/2/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443490911/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42065f07/sc/36/rc/2/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443490911/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42065f07/sc/36/rc/3/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443490911/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42065f07/sc/36/rc/3/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443490911/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42065f07/sc/36/a2.htm\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443490911/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42065f07/sc/36/a2.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/216443490911/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42065f07/sc/36/a2t.img\" border=\"0\"/><img src=\"//feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~4/ageOWXQZR24\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>"}, {:title=>"Inside Amsterdam's Efforts To Become a Smart City", :link=>"http://rss.slashdot.org/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~3/bSBcM-WzRrE/story01.htm", :summary=>"First time accepted submitter MollsEisley writes Throughout Amsterdam there are \"Living Labs,\" or communities that act as petri dishes for ideas and initiatives to be tested before scaling them across the city.

This new SoC is a \"tick\" in Intel's tick-tock plan, which means it's mostly a die shrink of the existing Haswell architecture, at least on the CPU side. On the GPU side, there's a bevy of improvements and advances, and the video decoder block has been beefed up with dual bit stream decoders in its high-end (GT3) hardware. Other feature improvements and capabilities are expected, though Intel has been quiet on exactly what they have tweaked and changed to date. Intel is claiming that the architecture will boost battery life by 1.5 hours, speed video conversions, and offer a whopping 22% improvement to 3D performance &mdash; a gain on par with what we saw when moving from Ivy Bridge to Haswell. Intel also took the wraps off their next gen Atom CPU, code named Cherry Trail. This is essentially a 14nm Bay Trail die shrink that's been on the roadmap for a while. As with Haswell-Broadwell, the Bay Trail-Cherry Trail shift is aimed at improving CPU power consumption and overall SoC power characteristics, though again, we'll see an updated GPU baked in as well.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\"> <a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Intel+Unveils+5th+Gen+Core+Series+Broadwell-U+CPUs+and+Cherry+Trail+Atom%3A+http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1Apsiph\"><img src=\"http://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a> <a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fhardware.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F15%2F01%2F05%2F1844225%2Fintel-unveils-5th-gen-core-series-broadwell-u-cpus-and-cherry-trail-atom%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"http://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a> <a class=\"nobg\" href=\"http://plus.google.com/share?url=http://hardware.slashdot.org/story/15/01/05/1844225/intel-unveils-5th-gen-core-series-broadwell-u-cpus-and-cherry-trail-atom?utm_source=slashdot&amp;utm_medium=googleplus\" onclick=\"javascript:window.open(this.href,'', 'menubar=no,toolbar=no,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes,height=600,width=600');return false;\"><img src=\"http://www.gstatic.com/images/icons/gplus-16.png\" alt=\"Share on Google+\"/></a> </div></p><p><a href=\"http://hardware.slashdot.org/story/15/01/05/1844225/intel-unveils-5th-gen-core-series-broadwell-u-cpus-and-cherry-trail-atom?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"http://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=6635815&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe><img width='1' height='1' src='http://slashdot.feedsportal.com/c/35028/f/647410/s/42076f3b/sc/15/mf.gif' border='0'/><br clear='all'/><br/><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443495514/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42076f3b/sc/15/rc/1/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443495514/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42076f3b/sc/15/rc/1/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443495514/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42076f3b/sc/15/rc/2/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443495514/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42076f3b/sc/15/rc/2/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443495514/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42076f3b/sc/15/rc/3/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443495514/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42076f3b/sc/15/rc/3/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443495514/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42076f3b/sc/15/a2.htm\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443495514/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42076f3b/sc/15/a2.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/216443495514/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42076f3b/sc/15/a2t.img\" border=\"0\"/><img src=\"//feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~4/P7yscTRTl4c\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>"}, {:title=>"Interviews: Ask Alexander Stepanov and Daniel E.

The software giant calls it its \"most affordable Internet-ready entry-level phone yet\", costing just $29.\"<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\"> <a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Microsoft+Unveils+Nokia+215%2C+a+%2429+Phone+With+Internet+Access%3A+http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1xKp7Hv\"><img src=\"http://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a> <a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fmobile.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F15%2F01%2F05%2F1241215%2Fmicrosoft-unveils-nokia-215-a-29-phone-with-internet-access%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"http://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a> <a class=\"nobg\" href=\"http://plus.google.com/share?url=http://mobile.slashdot.org/story/15/01/05/1241215/microsoft-unveils-nokia-215-a-29-phone-with-internet-access?utm_source=slashdot&amp;utm_medium=googleplus\" onclick=\"javascript:window.open(this.href,'', 'menubar=no,toolbar=no,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes,height=600,width=600');return false;\"><img src=\"http://www.gstatic.com/images/icons/gplus-16.png\" alt=\"Share on Google+\"/></a> </div></p><p><a href=\"http://mobile.slashdot.org/story/15/01/05/1241215/microsoft-unveils-nokia-215-a-29-phone-with-internet-access?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"http://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=6633293&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe><img width='1' height='1' src='http://slashdot.feedsportal.com/c/35028/f/647410/s/4204787f/sc/5/mf.gif' border='0'/><br clear='all'/><br/><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443553784/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/4204787f/sc/5/rc/1/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443553784/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/4204787f/sc/5/rc/1/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443553784/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/4204787f/sc/5/rc/2/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443553784/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/4204787f/sc/5/rc/2/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443553784/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/4204787f/sc/5/rc/3/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443553784/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/4204787f/sc/5/rc/3/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443553784/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/4204787f/sc/5/a2.htm\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443553784/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/4204787f/sc/5/a2.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/216443553784/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/4204787f/sc/5/a2t.img\" border=\"0\"/><img src=\"//feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~4/kboUxJuK5CM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>"}, {:title=>"NVIDIA Announces Tegra X1 Chip and Drive CX and PX Automotive Platforms", :link=>"http://rss.slashdot.org/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~3/e7PTuh3qiVQ/story01.htm", :summary=>"MojoKid writes For the last few years, NVIDIA has taken advantage of the lead-up to the Consumer Electronics Show to announce new Tegra-powered mobile architectures and this year we're being treated to more of the same. Today, NVIDIA unveiled its upcoming Tegra X1 system on a chip (SoC) and a few automotive computer systems leveraging the chip. Tegra X1 is a significant departure from the previous-gen Tegra K1 in that it features a 256 core Maxwell-derived GPU and eight CPU cores; four ARM A57 cores and four A53s in a big.LITTLE configuration. NVIDIA claims the Tegra X1 offers up to 2x the performance of the Tegra K1 in a similar power envelope, thanks to improved efficiency in the CPU and GPU cores and because the chips will be built using TSMC's 20nm manufacturing process. In addition to the Tegra X1 itself, NVIDIA also announced some new automotive computing platforms, the NVIDIA Drive CX Digital Cockpit Computer and Drive PX Auto-Pilot Platform, along with the Drive Studio software suite for developing in-car infotainment systems and autonomous driving systems.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\"> <a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=NVIDIA+Announces+Tegra+X1+Chip+and+Drive+CX+and+PX+Automotive+Platforms%3A+http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1yrzX8f\"><img src=\"http://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a> <a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fhardware.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F15%2F01%2F05%2F1231242%2Fnvidia-announces-tegra-x1-chip-and-drive-cx-and-px-automotive-platforms%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"http://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a> <a class=\"nobg\" href=\"http://plus.google.com/share?url=http://hardware.slashdot.org/story/15/01/05/1231242/nvidia-announces-tegra-x1-chip-and-drive-cx-and-px-automotive-platforms?utm_source=slashdot&amp;utm_medium=googleplus\" onclick=\"javascript:window.open(this.href,'', 'menubar=no,toolbar=no,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes,height=600,width=600');return false;\"><img src=\"http://www.gstatic.com/images/icons/gplus-16.png\" alt=\"Share on Google+\"/></a> </div></p><p><a href=\"http://hardware.slashdot.org/story/15/01/05/1231242/nvidia-announces-tegra-x1-chip-and-drive-cx-and-px-automotive-platforms?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"http://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=6633127&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe><img width='1' height='1' src='http://slashdot.feedsportal.com/c/35028/f/647410/s/42043910/sc/23/mf.gif' border='0'/><br clear='all'/><br/><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443494877/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42043910/sc/23/rc/1/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443494877/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42043910/sc/23/rc/1/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443494877/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42043910/sc/23/rc/2/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443494877/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42043910/sc/23/rc/2/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443494877/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42043910/sc/23/rc/3/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443494877/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42043910/sc/23/rc/3/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443494877/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42043910/sc/23/a2.htm\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443494877/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42043910/sc/23/a2.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/216443494877/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42043910/sc/23/a2t.img\" border=\"0\"/><img src=\"//feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~4/e7PTuh3qiVQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>"}, {:title=>"Nest Will Now Work With Your Door Locks, Light Bulbs and More", :link=>"http://rss.slashdot.org/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~3/HO-YCFBB_Mo/story01.htm", :summary=>"An anonymous reader writes with news about 15 new brand partnerships Nest announced today. \"When Google purchased Nest Labs &ndash; the maker of Internet-connected thermostats and smoke detectors &ndash; the search engine giant saw the potential to create a software platform for controlling the myriad everyday devices and gadgets in consumers' homes, a central hub for the so-called \"Internet of things.\" This vision took a major step towards becoming reality Monday morning, when Nest announced at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas that 15 new partners were joining its \"Works with Nest\" developer program.

From the article: \"The project, which is at pre-production prototype stage, was conceived by Bill Piedra, a part-time teacher at the King Low Heywood Thomas (KLHT) school in Stamford, Connecticut. Piedra began working on the design in January 2014 and then began developing it further with students at KLHT in September 2014. 'Ryptide was designed so that anyone can be a lifeguard,' Piedra tells Gizmag. 'We had the casual user in mind when we designed the basic model; someone that might take their drone to the beach, boating, a lake, or even ice skating.

Apple wants to have new software releases each year as a marketing hook, but the annual cycles of updating Apple's software are leading to too many bugs and problems, he says: I suspect the rapid decline of Apple's software is a sign that marketing has a bit too much power at Apple today: the marketing priority of having major new releases every year is clearly impossible for the engineering teams to keep up with while maintaining quality.

A collective of Swiss artists faced that very question when they coded the Random Darknet Shopper, an online shopping bot, to purchase random items from a marketplace located on the Deep Web, an area of the World Wide Web not indexed by search engines. While many of the 16,000 items for sale on this marketplace are legal, quite a few are not; and when the bot used its $100-per-week-in-Bitcoin to purchase a handful of illegal pills and a fake Hungarian passport, the artists found themselves in one of those conundrums unique to the 21st century: Is one liable when a bunch of semi-autonomous code goes off and does something bad? In a short piece in The Guardian, the artists seemed prepared to face the legal consequences of their software's actions, but nothing had happened yet&mdash;even though the gallery displaying the items is reportedly next door to a police station. In addition to the drugs and passport, the bot ordered a box set of The Lord of the Rings, a Louis Vuitton handbag, a couple of cartons of Chesterfield Blue cigarettes, sneakers, knockoff jeans, and much more.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\"> <a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Who's+Responsible+When+Your+Semi-Autonomous+Shopping+Bot+Purchases+Drugs+Online%3F%3A+http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1vUybpn\"><img src=\"http://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a> <a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftech.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F15%2F01%2F05%2F1854222%2Fwhos-responsible-when-your-semi-autonomous-shopping-bot-purchases-drugs-online%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"http://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a> <a class=\"nobg\" href=\"http://plus.google.com/share?url=http://tech.slashdot.org/story/15/01/05/1854222/whos-responsible-when-your-semi-autonomous-shopping-bot-purchases-drugs-online?utm_source=slashdot&amp;utm_medium=googleplus\" onclick=\"javascript:window.open(this.href,'', 'menubar=no,toolbar=no,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes,height=600,width=600');return false;\"><img src=\"http://www.gstatic.com/images/icons/gplus-16.png\" alt=\"Share on Google+\"/></a> </div></p><p><a href=\"http://tech.slashdot.org/story/15/01/05/1854222/whos-responsible-when-your-semi-autonomous-shopping-bot-purchases-drugs-online?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"http://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=6635865&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe><img width='1' height='1' src='http://slashdot.feedsportal.com/c/35028/f/647410/s/420728a8/sc/36/mf.gif' border='0'/><br clear='all'/><br/><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443556503/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/420728a8/sc/36/rc/1/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443556503/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/420728a8/sc/36/rc/1/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443556503/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/420728a8/sc/36/rc/2/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443556503/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/420728a8/sc/36/rc/2/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443556503/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/420728a8/sc/36/rc/3/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443556503/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/420728a8/sc/36/rc/3/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443556503/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/420728a8/sc/36/a2.htm\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443556503/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/420728a8/sc/36/a2.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/216443556503/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/420728a8/sc/36/a2t.img\" border=\"0\"/><img src=\"//feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~4/TrI35MEWo5E\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>"}, {:title=>"With 1 Million Papers, Preprint Site Is Changing the Way Science Is Shared (Scientific American)", :link=>"http://news.feedzilla.com/en_us/stories/science/413790560?client_source=api&format=json", :summary=>"Researchers upload papers to arXiv before peer review for faster feedback\n\n\n-- Read more on ScientificAmerican.com\n\n"}, {:title=>"Writers Say They Feel Censored By Surveillance", :link=>"http://rss.slashdot.org/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~3/y6gYQW8E9G4/story01.htm", :summary=>"schwit1 writes with news about the impact of government surveillance on authors and their work worldwide .

The findings show that writers consider freedom of expression to be under significant threat around the world in democratic and nondemocratic countries. Some 75 percent of respondents in countries classified as \"free,\" 84 percent in \"partly free\" countries, and 80 percent in countries that were \"not free\" said that they were \"very\" or \"somewhat\" worried about government surveillance in their countries. The survey, which will be released Monday, was conducted anonymously online in fall 2014 and yielded 772 responses from fiction and nonfiction writers and related professionals, including translators and editors, in 50 countries.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\"> <a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Writers+Say+They+Feel+Censored+By+Surveillance%3A+http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1Ax1Tad\"><img src=\"http://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a> <a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fyro.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F15%2F01%2F05%2F1445202%2Fwriters-say-they-feel-censored-by-surveillance%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"http://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\"></a> <a class=\"nobg\" href=\"http://plus.google.com/share?url=http://yro.slashdot.org/story/15/01/05/1445202/writers-say-they-feel-censored-by-surveillance?utm_source=slashdot&amp;utm_medium=googleplus\" onclick=\"javascript:window.open(this.href,'', 'menubar=no,toolbar=no,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes,height=600,width=600');return false;\"><img src=\"http://www.gstatic.com/images/icons/gplus-16.png\" alt=\"Share on Google+\"/></a> </div></p><p><a href=\"http://yro.slashdot.org/story/15/01/05/1445202/writers-say-they-feel-censored-by-surveillance?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p><iframe src=\"http://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.pl?op=discuss&amp;id=6634599&amp;smallembed=1\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 100%; border: none;\"></iframe><img width='1' height='1' src='http://slashdot.feedsportal.com/c/35028/f/647410/s/42069bcd/sc/1/mf.gif' border='0'/><br clear='all'/><br/><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443505850/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42069bcd/sc/1/rc/1/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443505850/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42069bcd/sc/1/rc/1/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443505850/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42069bcd/sc/1/rc/2/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443505850/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42069bcd/sc/1/rc/2/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443505850/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42069bcd/sc/1/rc/3/rc.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443505850/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42069bcd/sc/1/rc/3/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443505850/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42069bcd/sc/1/a2.htm\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/216443505850/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42069bcd/sc/1/a2.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/216443505850/u/49/f/647410/c/35028/s/42069bcd/sc/1/a2t.img\" border=\"0\"/><img src=\"//feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~4/y6gYQW8E9G4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>"}]

them off. But it&#39;s not just the light that&#39;s important. Researchers have found that the clam has sulfur in its fleshy lips and tentacles and suspect that, like another clam species that drop tentacles laden with sulfuric acid to deter predators, the disco clam&#39;s sulfur also gets converted into a distasteful substance. The flashing may warn predators away, similar to the bright orange of a monarch butterfly warning birds of its toxic taste.&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;share_submission&quot;

Bitcoin exchange, and still the preferred source of trading data for many technical analysts, sent an email at about 4:00 UTC today warning that, &quot;Today our transaction processing server detected problems with our hot wallet and stopped processing withdrawals.&quot; They also instructed users to stop sending any deposits immediately or they may be lost. The Bitstamp website has now also suspended all exchange/trading services, and the homepage contains only a maintenance message warning users of a &quot;compromised&quot; wallet. Numerous references to security imply that this is a hacking attack, but Bitstamp reassures that they maintain &quot;more than enough offline reserves to cover the compromised bitcoins.&quot;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;share_submission&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;slashpop&quot;

to subscribe to Cable or Satellite. From the article: &quot;For $20 a month &amp;mdash; yes, twenty dollars &amp;mdash; you get access to a lineup of cable networks that includes TNT, TBS, CNN, Food Network, HGTV, Cartoon Network, Adult Swim, the Disney Channel, ESPN, and ESPN2. ESPN is obviously a huge get for Dish and could earn Sling TV plenty of customers all on its own. ESPN just ended another year as TV&#39;s leading cable network, and now you won&#39;t need a traditional cable package to watch it. For sports fanatics, that could prove enticing. But Dish has hinted that there may be limits on watching ESPN on mobile thanks to red tape from existing deals between the network and Verizon.&quot;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;share_submission&quot;

The attack, which investigators said was launched from both Finland and abroad, began on New Year&#39;s Eve. OP was forced to open a helpline for customers unable to confirm payments or transfer money because of jammed systems. On Saturday the firm said it would compensate people for any losses or late payment fees incurred as a result of attack. On Sunday morning the bank tweeted that its services were operating normally and even customers based outside Finland were able to access their accounts &amp;mdash; and that it was still monitoring traffic carefully to try and ward off any renewed strikes. However, on Sunday afternoon further denial of service attacks took place delaying payments and preventing access to banking services for OP customers. A formal police complaint has been filed and OP says that KRP is looking into the case.&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;share_submission&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt; &lt;a

multimillion-dollar engines, ends up as trash in the ocean after one launching, something Elon Musk likens to throwing away a 747 jet after a single transcontinental flight. That&#39;s why tomorrow morning at 620 am his company hopes to upend the economics of space travel in a daring plan by attempting to land the first stage of a Falcon 9 rocket intact on a floating platform, 300 feet long and 170 feet wide in the Atlantic Ocean. SpaceX has attempted similar maneuvers on three earlier Falcon 9 flights, and on the second and third attempts, the rocket slowed to a hover before splashing into the water. &quot;We&#39;ve been able to soft-land the rocket booster in the ocean twice so far,&quot; says Musk. &quot;Unfortunately, it sort of sat there for several seconds, then tipped over and exploded. It&#39;s quite difficult to reuse at that point.&quot; After the booster falls away and the second stage continues pushing the payload to orbit, its engines will reignite to turn it around and guide it to a spot about 200 miles east of Jacksonville, Florida. Musk puts the chances of success at 50 percent or less but over the dozen or so flights scheduled for this year, &quot;I think it&#39;s quite likely, 80 to 90 percent likely, that one of those flights will be able to land and refly.&quot; SpaceX will offer its own launch webcast on the company&#39;s website beginning at 6 a.m. If SpaceX&#39;s gamble succeeds, the company plans to reuse the rocket stage on a later flight. &quot;Reusability is the critical breakthrough needed in rocketry to take things to the next level.&quot; SpaceX announced the plan in December.&lt;p&gt;&lt;div

Broadwell-U. This new SoC is a &quot;tick&quot; in Intel&#39;s tick-tock plan, which means it&#39;s mostly a die shrink of the existing Haswell architecture, at least on the CPU side. On the GPU side, there&#39;s a bevy of improvements and advances, and the video decoder block has been beefed up with dual bit stream decoders in its high-end (GT3) hardware. Other feature improvements and capabilities are expected, though Intel has been quiet on exactly what they have tweaked and changed to date. Intel is claiming that the architecture will boost battery life by 1.5 hours, speed video conversions, and offer a whopping 22% improvement to 3D performance &amp;mdash; a gain on par with what we saw when moving from Ivy Bridge to Haswell. Intel also took the wraps off their next gen Atom CPU, code named Cherry Trail. This is essentially a 14nm Bay Trail die shrink that&#39;s been on the roadmap for a while. As with Haswell-Broadwell, the Bay Trail-Cherry Trail shift is aimed at improving CPU power consumption and overall SoC power characteristics, though again, we&#39;ll see an updated GPU baked in as well.&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;share_submission&quot;

It is not a winning combination, especially for those living in developing markets, looking to be connected to the Internet while on the go. Enter Nokia 215, a dirt-cheap Internet-ready phone, which Microsoft announced earlier today. It packs some of the most-important features people want in a smartphone, but without any of the major drawbacks. The software giant calls it its &quot;most affordable Internet-ready entry-level phone yet&quot;, costing just $29.&quot;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;share_submission&quot;

announce new Tegra-powered mobile architectures and this year we&#39;re being treated to more of the same. Today, NVIDIA unveiled its upcoming Tegra X1 system on a chip (SoC) and a few automotive computer systems leveraging the chip. Tegra X1 is a significant departure from the previous-gen Tegra K1 in that it features a 256 core Maxwell-derived GPU and eight CPU cores; four ARM A57 cores and four A53s in a big.LITTLE configuration. NVIDIA claims the Tegra X1 offers up to 2x the performance of the Tegra K1 in a similar power envelope, thanks to improved efficiency in the CPU and GPU cores and because the chips will be built using TSMC&#39;s 20nm manufacturing process. In addition to the Tegra X1 itself, NVIDIA also announced some new automotive computing platforms, the NVIDIA Drive CX Digital Cockpit Computer and Drive PX Auto-Pilot Platform, along with the Drive Studio software suite for developing in-car infotainment systems and autonomous driving systems.&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;share_submission&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt; &lt;a

essence. The Ambulance Drone and Defikopter, for example, are used for transporting defibrillators to those in need. Now, Project Ryptide plans to use drones to deliver life-rings to swimmers in distress. From the article: &quot;The project, which is at pre-production prototype stage, was conceived by Bill Piedra, a part-time teacher at the King Low Heywood Thomas (KLHT) school in Stamford, Connecticut. Piedra began working on the design in January 2014 and then began developing it further with students at KLHT in September 2014. &#39;Ryptide was designed so that anyone can be a lifeguard,&#39; Piedra tells Gizmag. &#39;We had the casual user in mind when we designed the basic model; someone that might take their drone to the beach, boating, a lake, or even ice skating. It could be useful in the case of someone falling through the ice while skating, for example.&#39;&quot;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;share_submission&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;

In a blog post, he writes, &quot;Apple&#39;s hardware today is amazing &amp;mdash; it has never been better. But the software quality has taken such a nosedive in the last few years that I&#39;m deeply concerned for its future.&quot; Arment was CTO at Tumblr, before he left to start Instapaper. &quot;Apple has completely lost the functional high ground,&quot; says Arment. &quot;&#39;It just works&#39; was never completely true, but I don&#39;t think the list of qualifiers and asterisks has ever been longer.&quot; He blames Apple prioritizing marketing for the problems with Apple&#39;s software. Apple wants to have new software releases each year as a marketing hook, but the annual cycles of updating Apple&#39;s software are leading to too many bugs and problems, he says: I suspect the rapid decline of Apple&#39;s software is a sign that marketing has a bit too much power at Apple today: the marketing priority of having major new releases every year is clearly impossible for the engineering teams to keep up with while maintaining quality. Maybe it&#39;s an engineering problem, but I suspect not &amp;mdash; I doubt that any cohesive engineering team could keep up with these demands and maintain significantly higher quality.&quot;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;share_submission&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;slashpop&quot;

A collective of Swiss artists faced that very question when they coded the Random Darknet Shopper, an online shopping bot, to purchase random items from a marketplace located on the Deep Web, an area of the World Wide Web not indexed by search engines. While many of the 16,000 items for sale on this marketplace are legal, quite a few are not; and when the bot used its $100-per-week-in-Bitcoin to purchase a handful of illegal pills and a fake Hungarian passport, the artists found themselves in one of those conundrums unique to the 21st century: Is one liable when a bunch of semi-autonomous code goes off and does something bad? In a short piece in The Guardian, the artists seemed prepared to face the legal consequences of their software&#39;s actions, but nothing had happened yet&amp;mdash;even though the gallery displaying the items is reportedly next door to a police station. In addition to the drugs and passport, the bot ordered a box set of The Lord of the Rings, a Louis Vuitton handbag, a couple of cartons of Chesterfield Blue cigarettes, sneakers, knockoff jeans, and much more.&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;share_submission&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;slashpop&quot;

A survey of writers around the world by the PEN American Center has found that a significant majority said they were deeply concerned with government surveillance, with many reporting that they have avoided, or have considered avoiding, controversial topics in their work or in personal communications as a result. The findings show that writers consider freedom of expression to be under significant threat around the world in democratic and nondemocratic countries. Some 75 percent of respondents in countries classified as &quot;free,&quot; 84 percent in &quot;partly free&quot; countries, and 80 percent in countries that were &quot;not free&quot; said that they were &quot;very&quot; or &quot;somewhat&quot; worried about government surveillance in their countries. The survey, which will be released Monday, was conducted anonymously online in fall 2014 and yielded 772 responses from fiction and nonfiction writers and related professionals, including translators and editors, in 50 countries.&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;share_submission&quot;
